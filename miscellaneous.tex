\item Two H.M.'s were inserted between two numbers and one of them is equal to the geometric mean between
  the numbers. Prove that one number is equal to four times the other number.
\item The H.M. of two numbers is $4$. The A.M. \quote{A} and G.M. \quote{G} satisfy the relationship $2A +
  G^2 = 27$. Find the numbers.
\item If $n$ is odd find the sum of the series $a - (a + d) + (a + 2d) - (a + 3d) + \cdots$.
\item For what value of $y$, the equation $\cos x = y$ has roots in A.P.
\item Sum of all terms of a G.P.\ is $5$ times the sum of odd terms. Find the common ratio.
