\section{Polynomial Functions}
A function of the form $f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n - 1}x^{n - 1} + \cdots + a_1x + a_0$ is callled a polynomial
function where $a_i\in\mathbb{C}$, where $i = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, n$ i.e. $i \geq 0$ and
$i\in\mathbb{I}$. Since $a_i\in\mathbb{C}$, it is evident that $a_i\in\mathbb{R}$ because
$\mathbb{R}\subset\mathbb{C}$. This equation will be called an equation of degree $n$ if and only if
$a_n\neq 0$. $a_n$ is called {\it leading} coefficient of the polynomial. If the leading coefficient is $1$
then the polynomial is also callled {\it monic} polynomial. A polynomial with one term is called {\it
  monomial}, with two terms, a {\it binomial} and with three terms it is called a {\it trinomial}. The most
useful trinomials are quadratic equations, which we will study further in this chapter. If $f(x) = a_0$,
then it is called a {\it constant} polynomial. If $n = 0$ implies $f(x) = a_0$, which will be a polynomial
of degree $0$. If $f(x) = 0$, then it is callled {\it zero} polynomial, in this case the degree is defined
as $-\infty$ to satisfy the first two properties given below. We take domain and range of these polynimoials
or functions as set of complex numbers, $\mathbb{C}$. A real number $r$ or a complex number $z$, for which
$f(r) = 0$ or $f(z) = 0$, then $r$ and $z$ are called {\it zeros, roots} or {\it solutions} of the
polynomial.

If $f(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $p$, and $g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $q$, then

\startitemize[n]
\item $f(x)\pm g(x)$ is a polymnoial of degree $\max(p, q)$,
\item $f(x).g(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $p + q$, and
\item $f(g(x))$ is a polynomial of degree $p.q$, where $g(x)$ is not a constant polynomial.
\stopitemize

The $f(x)$ shown at the beginning is a polynomial in one variable, and similarly, we can have polynomials in
$2, 3, \ldots, m$ variables. The domain of such a polynomial of $m$ variables is set of ordered $m$ tuple of
complex numbers and range is $\mathbb{C}$.

\section{Division of Polynomials}
If $P(x)$ and $D(x)$ are any two polynomials such that $D(x)\nequiv 0$, then two unique polynomilas $Q(x)$
and $R(x)$ can be found such that $P(x) = D(x).Q(x) + R(x)$. Here, the degree of $R(x)$ would be less than
the degree of $D(x)$ or $R(x)\equiv 0$. Like numbers $Q(x)$ denotes the quotient, and is called so, while
$R(x)$ is called the remainder.

Particulalrly, if $P(x)$ is a polynomial with complex coefficients and $z$ is a complex number, then a
polynomial $Q(x)$ of degree $1$ less than $P(x)$ will exist such that $P(x) = (x - z)Q(x) + R$, where $R$ is
a complex number.

\section{Remainder Theorem}
\starttheorem
  If $f(x)$, a polynomial, is divided by $(x - \alpha)$, then the remainder is $f(\alpha)$.
\stoptheorem

\startproof
  $f(x) = (x - \alpha)Q(x) + R\Rightarrow f(\alpha) = (\alpha - \alpha)Q(x) + R \Rightarrow R = f(\alpha)$.
\stopproof

\section{Factor Theorem}
\starttheorem
  $f(x)$ has a factor $(x - \alpha)$, if and only if, $f(\alpha) = 0$
\stoptheorem

\startproof
  Following from remainder theorem, described above, if $R = f(\alpha) = 0$, then $f(\alpha) = (x -
  \alpha)Q(x)$, and thus, $f(x)$ has a factor $(x - \alpha)$.
\stopproof

\section{Fundamental Theorem of Algebra}
Every polynomial of degree greater or equal than one has at least one root/solution/zero in the complex
numbers. We can also say that for $f(x)$ introduced in the beginning with $n\geq 1$, then there exists a
$z\in\mathbb{C}$, such that

\startformula f(z) = a_nz^n + a_{n - 1}z^{n - 1} + \cdots + a_1z + a_0 = 0.\stopformula

Now it is trivial to deduce that an $n$th degree polynomial will have exactly $n$ roots i.e. $f(x) = a(x -
\alpha_1)(x - \alpha_2)\cdots(x - \alpha_{n - 1})(x - \alpha_n)$.

{\bf Notes}:
\startitemize[n]
\item Some of the roots of the polynomial may have repetition.
\item If a root $\alpha$ repeats $m$ times, then $m$ is called {\it multiplicity} of the root $\alpha$
  or $\alpha$ is called $m$ fold root.
\item Quadratic surds of the form $\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}$, where $\sqrt{a}$ and $\sqrt{b}$ are irrational
  numbers, then it will have its conjugate as a root. Similarly, if a complex root occurs, then it always
  occurs in pair with its complex conjugate as another root of the polynomial. However, if the coefficients
  are complex numbers then it is not mandatory for complex roots to appear in conjugate pairs.
\stopitemize

\section{Identity Theorem}
\starttheorem
  If $f(x)$, a polynomial of degree $n$, vanishes for at least $n + 1$ distinct values of $x$, then it is
  identically $0$.
\stoptheorem
\startproof
  We have $f(x) = a(x - \alpha_1)(x - \alpha_2)\cdots(x - \alpha_{n - 1})(x - \alpha_n)$, and we let that it
  vanishes for $\alpha_{n + 1}$, then

  \startformula f(x) = a(\alpha_{n + 1} - \alpha_1)(\alpha_{n + 1} - \alpha_2)\cdots(\alpha_{n + 1} -
    \alpha_{n - 1})(\alpha_{n + 1} - \alpha_n) = 0\stopformula

  Because $\alpha_{n + 1}$ is different from $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_{n - 1}, \alpha_n$ none of
  the terms will vanish, which implies that $a = 0 \Rightarrow f(x) = 0$.
\stopproof

\startcorollary
  Consider two poynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ having degrees $p$ and $q$ respectively, such that $p\leq q$. If
  both of them have equal value for $q + 1$ distinct values of $x$, then they must be equal.
\stopcorollary

\startproof
  Let $h(x) = f(x) - g(x)$. This implies that the degree of $h(x)$ is at most $q$ and it vanishes for $q +
  1$ distinct values of $x$. $\Rightarrow h(x) = f(x) - g(x) = 0 \Rightarrow f(x) = g(x)$.
\stopproof

\startcorollary
  If $f(x)$ is a periodic polynomial with some constant period $T$ i.e. $f(x) = f(x +
  T)\;\forall\;x\in\mathbb{R}$, then $f(x) = c$.
\stopcorollary

\startproof
  Let $f(0) = x$, then $f(0) = f(T) = f(2T) = \cdots = c$. Thus, polynomials $f(x)$ and $g(x) = c$ take same
  values for infinite number of points. Hence, they must be identical.
\stopproof

\section{Rational Root Theorem}
\starttheorem
If $p, q\in\mathbb{Z}, q\neq 0$ such that they are relatively prime i.e. $gcd(p, q) = 1$, then if
$\frac{p}{q}$ is a root of the equation $a_nx^n + a_{n - 1}x^{n - 1} + \cdots + a_1x + a_0 = 0$, where $a_0,
a_1, \ldots, a_{n - 1}, a_n \in\mathbb{I}$ and $a_n = 0$, then $p$ is a divisor of $a_0$ and $q$ that of
$a_n$.
\stoptheorem

\startproof
  Since $\frac{p}{q}$ is a root, we have
  \startformula a_n\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)^n + a_{n - 1}\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)^{n - 1} + \cdots +
    a_1\frac{p}{q} + a_0 = 0\stopformula
  $\Rightarrow a_np^n + a_{n - 1}p^{n - 1}q + \cdots + a_1q^{n - 1}p + a_0q^n = 0$

  $\Rightarrow a_{n - 1}p^{n - 1} + a_{n - 1}p^{n - 2}q + \cdots + a_1pq^{n - 2} + a_0q^{n - 1} =
    -a_n\frac{p^n}{q}$

  Everything on L.H.S. is integer and $p, q$ are relatively prime therefore $q$ must divide $a_n$.
  Similalry, it can be proven that $a_0$ is divisible by $q$.
\stopproof

\startcorollary
  {\bf Integer Root Theorem} If roots of $x^n + a_{n - 1}x^{n - 1} + \cdots + a_1x + a_0 = 0$, where $0\leq i\leq n- 1$ are integers
  and coefficients are also integer, are integer then all the roots divide $a_0$.
\stopcorollary
\startproof
  This corollary is a direct result from previous corollary.
\stopproof

\section{Vieta's Relations}
If $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \ldots, \alpha_n$ are $n$ roots of the equation $a_nx^n + a_{n - 1}x^{n - 1} +
\cdots + a_1x + a_0 = 0$, then \m{\displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^n\alpha_i = -\frac{a_{n - 1}}{a_n}, \sum_{1\leq
  i\leq j\leq n}\alpha_i\alpha_j = \frac{a_{n - 2}}{a_n}, \sum_{1\leq i\leq j\leq k\leq
  n}\alpha_i\alpha_j\alpha_n = -\frac{a_{n - 3}}{a_n}, \cdots, \alpha_1\alpha_2\ldots\alpha_n =
(-1)^n\frac{a_0}{a_n}}.

These relations are denoted as $\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \ldots, \sigma_n$ as well.
These relations are known as Vieta's relations.

\section{Symmetric Functions}
Consider functions $a + b + c, a^2 + b^2 + c^2, (a - b)^2 + (b - c)^2 + (c - a)^2,$ and $(a + b)(b + c)(c +
a)$ in which the terms can be interchanged without changing the overall function. Functions demonstrating
such behavior are known as {\it symmetric} functions.

In general, if a function is of $n$ variables then this definition warrants that any two variable can be
interchanged without changing the function. Thus, we see that Vieta's relations are symmetric functions.

\section{Common Roots of Polynomial Equations}
If $\alpha$ is a common root of the polynomial equations $f(x) = 0$ and $g(x) = 0$, if and only if, it is a
root of the HCF of the polynomilas $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. The HCF of two polynomials can be found exactly like
HCF of two integers using Euclid's method.

\section{Irreducabilty of Polynomials}
When we talk of irreducability we talk in terms of set to which the coefficients of the polynomial
belong. The set could be $\mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.

An irreducible polynomial is, a non-constant polynomial which cannot have non-constant factors in the same
set as coefficients of the polynomial itself.

Consider following example:

\startitemize[n]
\item $x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3)$
\item $x^2 - \frac{4}{9} = \left(x - \frac{2}{3}\right)\left(x + \frac{2}{3}\right)$
\item $x^2 - 5 = (x - \sqrt{5})(x + \sqrt{5})$
\item $x^2 + 9 = (x + 3i)(x - 3i)$
\stopitemize

Over $\mathbb{I}$, first is reducible while other are irreducible, over $\mathbb{Q}$ first two are reducible
bit last two are not, over $\mathbb{R}$, first three are reducible but last one is not and over $\mathbb{C}$
all are reducible.

\subsection{Gausss' Lemma}
If a polynomial with integer coefficients is reducible over $\mathbb{Q}$, then it is reducible over
$\mathbb{Z}$.

\section{Eisenstein's Irreducibility Criterion Theorem}
\starttheorem
Consider the polynomial $f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n - 1}x^{n - 1} + \cdots + a_1x + a_0$ with integer
coefficients. If there exists a prime $p$ such that the following three conditions apply
\startitemize[n]
\item $p$ divides each $a_i$ for $0\leq i < n$,
\item $p$ does not divide $a_n$, and
\item $p^2$ does not divide $a_0$,
\stopitemize
then $f(x)$ is irreducible over rational numbers and integers.
\stoptheorem

\startproof
If possible, let us assume that $f(x) = g(x).h(x)$ such that $g(x) = b_kx^k + b_{k - 1}x^{k - 1} + \cdots +
b_1x + b_0$ and $h(x) = c_lx^l + c_{l - 1}x^{l - 1} + \cdots + c_1 + c_0$, where $b_i,
c_i\in\mathbb{Z}\;\forall\;i = 0, 1, 2, \ldots; b_k\neq, c_l\neq 0; 1\leq k, l\leq n - 1$.

Comparing leading coefficient on both sides, we have $a_n = b_kc_l$. As $p\nmid a_n\Rightarrow p\nmid
b_kc_l\Rightarrow p\nmid b_k$ and $p\nmid c_l$.

Similarly, $a_0 = b_0c_0$. As $p|a_0$ and $p^2\nmid a_0\Rightarrow p|b_0c_0$, but both $b_0$ and $c_0$
cannot be divided by $p$. Without loss of generality, we suppose $p|b_0$ and $p\nmid c_0$. Suppose $i$ be
the smallest index such that $b_i$ is not divisible by $p$. There is such an index $i$ since $p\nmid b_k$,
where $1\leq i\leq k$. Depending on $i$ and $k$, for $i\leq k, a_i = b_ic_0 + b_{i-1}c_1 + \cdots + b_0c_i$
and for $i > k, a_i = b_ic_0 + b_{i-1}c_1 + \cdots + b_{i-k}c_k$.

We have $p|a_i$ and by supposition $p$ divides each one of $b_0, b_1, \ldots, b_{i - 1}\Rightarrow
p|b_ic_0$. But $p\nmid c_0 \Rightarrow p|b_i$, which is a contradiction, and therefore, $f(x)$ is
irreducible.
\stopproof

\section{Extended Eisenstein's Irreducibility Criterion Theorem}
\starttheorem
  Let $f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n - 1}x^{n - 1} + \cdots + a_1x + a_0$ be a polynomial with integer
  coefficient. If there exists a prime number $p$ and an integer $k\in\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n - 1\}$ such that
  $p\mid a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_k;p\nmid a_{k + 1}$ and $p^2\nmid a_0$, then $f(x)$ has an irreducible factor
  of degree at least $k + 1$. In particular if $p$ can be taken so that $k = n - 1$, then $f(x)$ is
  irreducible.
\stoptheorem
\startproof
  Suppose that $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$ such that \startformula g(x) = b_kx^k + b_{k - 1}x^{k - 1} + \cdots + b_1x
  + b_0\stopformula
  \startformula h(x) = c_rx^r + c_{r - 1}x^{r - 1} + \cdots + c_1x + c_0\stopformula
    where $b_i, c_i\in\mathbb{Z}\;\forall\;i = 0, 1, 2, \ldots;b_k \neq 0, c_r\neq 0; 1\leq m, r\leq n - 1$.

  Since $a_0 = b_0c_0$ is divisible by $p$ and not by $p^2$, exactly one of $b_0, c_0$ is a multiple of
  $p$. Without loss of generality assume that $p\mid b_0$ and $p\nmid c_0$.

  Now $p\mid a_1 = b_0c_1 + b_1c_0 \Rightarrow p\mid b_1c_0\Rightarrow p\mid b_1$.

  Simmilarly, $p\mid a_2 = b_0c_2 + b_1c_2 + b_2c_0\Rightarrow p\mid b_2c_0\Rightarrow p\mid b_2$ and so on.

  We conclude that all coefficients $b_0, b_1, \ldots, b_k$ are divisible by $p$. Now, $a_{k + 1} = b_kc_1 +
  b_{k - 1}c_2 + b_{k - 2}c_2 + \ldots \Rightarrow p\nmid a_{k + 1}$. It follows that degree of $g\geq k  + 1$.
\stopproof
\section{Quadratic Equations}
An equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a, b, c\in \mathbb{C}$, the set of complex numbers, is
called a {\it quadratic equation}. The numbers $a, b, c$ are called {\it coefficients} of the equation. The
quantity $b^2 - 4ac$ is called the {\it discriminant} of the equation. It is represented by $D$ or
$\Delta$. A quadratic equation represents a parabola geometrically.

\noindent{\bf Examples:}
\startitemize[n]
\item $4x^2 + 4x + 1 = 0, a = 4, b = 4, c = 1$.
\item $7x^3 + 10 = 0$ is not a quadratic equation because the power of $x$ is greater than $2$.
\item $3x^2 -2x^{1/2} + 7 = 0$ is not a quadratic equation is not a quaadratic equation because the power of $x$ in
  the second term is not $1$.
\item $2x^2 - 4 = 0, a = 2, b = 0, c= -4$.
\stopitemize

A quadratic equation is called {\it incomplete} if one of $b$ or $c$ is zero. Thus, the last example above
represents an incomplete quadratic equation.

An expression of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$ is called a {\it quadratic expression} while other elements are same as a quadratic
equation.

If two expression in $x$ are equal for all values of $x$ then this statement of equality between the two expression is called an
{\it identity}.

$f(x) = 0$ is said to be an identity in $x$ if it is satisfied by all values of $x$ in the domain of $f(x)$. Thus, an identity in
$x$ is satisfied by all values of $x$ while an equation is satisfied for particular values of $x$.

\noindent{\bf Example:} $(x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1$ is an identity in $x$.

Two equations are called {\it identical equations} if they have same roots.

\noindent{\bf Example:} $x^2 - 5x + 4 = 0$ and $2x^2 - 10x + 8 = 0$ are identical equations because both have same roots $1$ and $4$.

\noindent{\bf Note:}
\startitemize[n]
\item Two equations in $x$ are identical if and only if the coefficients of similar power of $x$ in the two equations are
  proportional. Thus, if $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and $a_1x^2 + b_1x + c_1 = 0$ are identical equations, then $\frac{a}{a_1} =
  \frac{b}{b_1} = \frac{c}{c_1}$
\item An equation remains unchanged if it is multiplied or divided by non-zero number.
\stopitemize

An expression of the form $a_0x^n + a_1x^{n - 1} + a_2x^{n - 2} + \ldots + a_{n - 1}x + a_0$, where $a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$
are constants $(a_0 \neq 0)$ and $n$ is a positive integer is called a polynomial in $x$ of degree $n$.

As a special case a constant is also called a polynomial of degree zero.

\section{Rational Expression and Rational Function}
An expression of the form $\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$, where $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are polynomials in $x$, is called a rational expression.

In the particular case, when $Q(x)$ is a non-zero constant, $\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$ reduces to a polynomial.Thus, every polynomial is a
rational expression but the converse is not true.

\noindent{\bf Examples:}
\startitemize[n]
\item $\frac{x^2 - 5x + 4}{x - 2}$
\item $\frac{1}{x - 7}$
\stopitemize

\section{Roots of a Quadratic Equation}
The values $x$ for which the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ are satisfied are called roots of the equation. They are also called
roots of the quadratic expression $ax^2 + bx + c$

Every quadratic equation has at most two roots. Let $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a\neq 0$

Multiplying both sides of the equation with $a$

$a^2x^2 + abx + ac = 0 \Rightarrow (ax)^2 + 2.ax.\frac{b}{2} + \frac{b^2}{4} + ac - \frac{b^2}{4} = 0$

$\left(ax + \frac{b}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{b^2 - 4ac}{4} \Rightarrow x = \frac{-b \pm\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

These are two roots of the quadratic equation. Let us suppose the above quadratic equation has three roots $\alpha, \beta$ and
$\gamma$. These roots will satisfy the above equation. Thus,
\startformula a\alpha^2 + b\alpha + c = 0, a\beta^2 + b\beta + c = 0, a\gamma^2 + b\gamma + c = 0\stopformula

Subtracting the first two, we get $(\alpha - \beta)[a(\alpha + \beta) + b] = 0$

$\because \alpha \neq \beta \therefore a(\alpha + \beta) + b = 0$

Similarly, $a(\alpha + \gamma) + b = 0$

Subtracting these two, we get $a(\alpha - \gamma) = 0$

$\because a\neq 0 \therefore \alpha = \gamma$

Thus, a quadratic equation has at most two roots.

\section{Sum and Product of the Roots}
From the two obtained  we observe that $\alpha + \beta = -\frac{b}{a}$ and $\alpha\beta = \frac{c}{a}$

\section{Nature of Roots}
For equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ when $a,b,c$ are real.
\startitemize[n]
\item When $D < 0$

  In this case, both roots will be either imaginary or complex numbers depending on whether $b$ is zero or not. These roots are
  conjugate of each other.
\item When $D = 0$

  In this case, both roots will be equal.
\item When $D > 0$

  In this case, both roots will be equal and unqual. If $D$ is not a perfect square then roots are irrational and come as a pair of
  conjugate irrational numbers.
\item When $D$ is a perfect square and $a, b, c$ are rationals.

  In this case, both roots are real and unequal.
\stopitemize

\subsection{Conjugate Roots}
Imaginary/complex roots of a quadratic equation with real coefficients always occur in conjugate pair.

Let $\alpha + i\beta$ be a root of the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a, b, c$ are real numbers. Thus,

$a(\alpha + i\beta)^2 + b(\alpha + i\beta) + c = 0$

$\Rightarrow (a\alpha^2 - a\beta^2 + b\alpha + c) + (2a\alpha\beta + b\beta)i = 0$

Equating real and imaginary parts

$a\alpha^2 - a\beta^2 + b\alpha + c = 0, 2a\alpha\beta + b\beta = 0$

Using $\alpha - i\beta$ as the second root of the equation

$a(\alpha - i\beta)^2 + b(\alpha - i\beta) + c = (a\alpha^2 - a\beta62 + b\alpha + c) + (2a\alpha\beta + b\beta)i$

$= 0 + i.0$

Thus, we see that $\alpha - i\beta$ also satisfied the equation and is second root of the equation. Similarly, if the roots are
irrational they also appear as conjugate pair.

\section{Quadratic Expression and its Graph}
Let $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a, b, c\in\mathbb{R}$ and $a\neq 0$.

\placeformula[eq:1]
\startformula
  f(x) = a\left[\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 + \frac{4ac - b^2}{4a^2}\right]
\stopformula

\subsection{When a Quadratic Equation is Always Positive/Negative}
It follows from \in{Eq.}[eq:1], that $f(x) > 0(< 0)\;\forall\;x\in\mathbb{R}$ if and only if $a > 0(< 0)$ and $D = b^2 - 4ac <
0$. See \in{Figure}[fig:1](\in{Figure}[fig:2]). Also, it follows from \ref{eq:1} that $f(x) \geq 0(\leq 0)\;\forall\;x\in\mathbb{R}$ if
and only if $a > 0(< 0)$ and $D = b^2 - 4ac = 0$. in this case $f(x) < 0(< 0)$ for each $x\in R, x\neq -b/2a$, and the graph of $y
= f(x)$ touches the $x$-axis at $x = -b/2a$.

\section{Sign of a Quadratic Equation}
If $D = b^2 - 4ac > 0$, then eq. \in{Equation}[eq:1] can be written as

\startformula f(x) = a\left[\left(x + \frac{b}{2a}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\right)^2\right]\stopformula
\startformula = a\left[\left(x + \frac{b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\right)\left(x + \frac{b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\right)\right]\stopformula
\startformula = a(x - \alpha)(x - \beta)\stopformula

If $D = b^2 - 4ac > 0$ and $a > 0$, then (See \in{Figure}[fig:3])

\startformula f(x) = \startmathcases > 0\text{~for~}x <\alpha\text{~or~}x
  >\beta\NR>0\text{~for~}\alpha<x<\beta\\=0\text{~for~}x=\alpha,\beta\NR\stopmathcases\stopformula

\startplacefigure[title={When $D > 0$ and $a > 0$}, reference=fig:3]
  \externalfigure[quadratic-equation-3.pdf]
\stopplacefigure

If $D = b^2 - 4ac > 0$ and $a < 0$, then (See \in{Figure}[fig:4])

\startformula f(x) = \startmathcases < 0\text{~for~}x <\alpha\text{~or~}x
  >\beta\\>0\text{~for~}\alpha<x<\beta\\=0\text{~for~}x=\alpha,\beta\stopmathcases\stopformula

Note that if $a > 0$, then $f(x)$ attains the least value at $x = -b/2a$, a value which is achieved by differentiating the function
once and at this point the tangent to parabola has slope $0$. The least value is given by
\startformula f\left(-\frac{b}{2a}\right) = \frac{4ac - b^2}{4a}\stopformula

If $a < 0$, then $f(x)$ is maximum at value $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$ and value of function has the same formula which is for least value
shown above.

Form the Fig. \in{Figure}[fig:5], we note that both the roots are more than $k$ if and only if $D>0,\;k<-\frac{b}{2a}$ and $f(k)>0$.

In case $a< 0,$ from Fig. \in{Figure}[fig:6], both the roots are more than $k$ if and only if $D>0,\;k<-\frac{b}{2a}$ and $f(k)<0$.


\startplacefigure[title={When $D > 0$ and $a < 0$}, reference=fig:6]

Combining the above two equations, we get the condition for the roots to be more than a real number $k$ if and only if
$D>0,\;k<-\frac{b}{2a}$ and $af(k)>0$. Similarly, condition for the roots to be more than a real number $k$ if and only if
$D>0,\;k>-\frac{b}{2a}$ and $af(k)>0$.


\noindent{\bf Conditions for a real number $k$ to lie between two roots}

Similarly, the real number $k$ lies between the roots of the quadratic equation if and only if $a$ and $f(k)$ are of opposite
signs, i.e. if and only if $a>0,\;D>0,\;f(k) < 0$ or $a< 0,\;D>0,\;f(k)>0$.

Combining these two, we get $D>0,\;af(k) < 0$ as the condition for $k$ to lie between two roots.

\noindent{\bf Conditions for exactly one root to lie in between $(k_1, k_2)$ where $k_1<k_2$}

If $a>0$, then exactly one root lies in the interval $(k_1, k_2)$ if and only if $f(k_1)>0$ and $f(k_2)<0$. Also, same is true if
anad only if $f(k_1)<0$ and $f(k_2)>0$. Combining these two we get $f(k_1)f(k_2) < 0$. This condition is also true if $a<0$.

\noindent{\bf Conditions for both roots to lie in between $(k_1, k_2)$ where $k_1<k_2$}

If $a >0$, both the roots will lies in the interval $(k_1, k_2)$ if and only if $D>0,\;k_1<-\frac{b}{2a}<k_2,\;f(k_1)>0$ and
$f(k_1)>0$. In case $a<0$, the conditions are $D>0,\;k_1<-\frac{b}{2a}<k_2,\;f(k_1)<0$ and $f(k_1)<0$.

\noindent{\bf Conditions for the quadratic equation to have repeated roots}

The quadratic equation $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c = 0, a\neq 0$ has a repeated root if and only if $f(\alpha) = f'(\alpha) = 0$, where
$\alpha$ is the repeated root. In this case, $f(x) = a(x - \alpha)^2$, In fact, $\alpha = -b/2a$. Geometrically, the $x$-axis will
be a tangent to the parabola at $x = -b/2a$. See \in{Figure}[fig:7] and Fig. \in{Figure}[fig:8].

\noindent{bf Conditions for two quadratic equations to have one common root}

Consider two quadratic equations $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and $a'x^2 + b'x^2 + c' = 0$ having a common root $\alpha$. Clearly, this
common root will satisfy both the equations, i.e. $a\alpha^2 + b\alpha + c = 0$ and $a'\alpha^2 + b'\alpha + c' = 0$.

Solving these two equations, we get

\startformula \frac{\alpha^2}{bc' - b'c} = \frac{\alpha}{a'c - ac'} = \frac{1}{ab' - a'b}\stopformula
\startformula \Rightarrow \alpha^2 = \frac{bc' - b'c}{ab' - a'b}, \alpha = \frac{a'c - ac'}{ab' - a'b}\stopformula

Eliminating $\alpha$, we get

\startformula (a'c - ac')^2 = (bc' - b'c)(ab' - a'b)\stopformula

This is the required condition for two quadratic equations to have one common root.

\startplacefigure[title={Common roots}, reference=fig:10]
  \externalfigure[quadratic-equation-10.pdf]
\stopplacefigure

To obtain the common root make coefficients of $x^2$ in both the equations same and subtract one equation from the other to obtain
a linear equation in $x$, which you can solve to obtain the common root.

For having both roots common the two equations must be identical i.e. $\frac{a}{a'} = \frac{b}{b'} = \frac{c}{c'}$

\section{General Quadratic Equation in $x$ and $y$}
The general quadratic equation in $x$ and $y$ is given by $ax^2 + 2hxy + by^2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0$

\startformula \therefore x = \frac{-2(hy + g)\pm\sqrt{4(hy + g)^2 - 4a(by^2 + 2fy + c)}}{2a}\stopformula
\startformula \Rightarrow x + hy + g = \pm \sqrt{(h^2 - ab)y^2 + 2(gh - af)y + g^2 - ac}\stopformula

It can be resolved into two linear factors if $(h^2 - ab)y^2 + 2(gh - af)y + g^2 - ac$ is a perfect square and $h^2 - ab > 0$.

The condition for $(h^2 - ab)y^2 + 2(gh - af)y + g^2 - ac$ to be a perfect square is that its discriminant is $0$, i.e.

\startformula 4(gh - af)^2 - 4(h^2 - ab)(g^2 - ac) = 0\stopformula

-\frac{d}{a}\stopformula

Also, if $\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta$ are the roots of the equation $ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + d + e = 0$, then

\gamma\delta = \frac{c}{a}\stopformula
\startformula \alpha\beta\gamma + \alpha\beta\delta + \alpha\gamma\delta + \beta\gamma\delta = -\frac{d}{a}, \alpha\beta\gamma\delta =
