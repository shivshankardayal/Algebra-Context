\chapter{Combinatorics}
In this chapter we will study basic principles of counting, permutations and combinations. This study will enable you to further
study the branch of mathematics called combinatorics. You would have certainly encountered a combinatorical problem in your
life. It would be really surprising if you have not. Have you ever solved a Sudoku puzzle or Rubik's cube? Have you ever counted
the number of poker hands that are full houses in order to determine the odds against a full house? Have you ever attempted to
trace through a network without removing your pencil from paper and without tracing any part of network more than once? These are
all combinatorical problems. As you can see that combinatorics has evolved from mathematical games.

With the invention of modern computers, we are enabled to solve more and more problems of combinatorics which were earlier not
feasible due to calculations involved. The computer programs are often based on combinatorical algorithms which determine the speed
and efficiency of the solution. Analysis of these programs and algorithms require sound knowledge of combinatorical mathematics and
thinking. In computer science we write test cases for our programs, and those test cases can be enumerated by applying permutations
and combinations on input data and states produced in the program. Combinatorics is a powerful tool for making sure that the tester
does not miss any test case, which in mission-critical programs is of paramount importance.

The best way to learn combinatorics is to solve a lot of problems. This is in general true for all branches of mathematics but even
more so for combinatorics because a problem which appears simple may be quite difficult to solve or require critical thinking. By
solving problems of different kinds, and by repeating them the concepts will be enforced and discipline will develop.

We start with four basic counting principles and then we will progress into permutations and combinatins. To study the topic of
permutations and combinations it is required to have basic knowledge in set theory which the reader is expected to know.

\section{Four Basic Counting Principles}
Let $S$ be a set. A {\it partition} of $S$ is a collection of $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_m$ of subsets of $S$ such that each element
in $S$ is in exactly one of these subsets:
\startformula S = S_1\cup S_2\cup\ldots\cup S_m\stopformula
\startformula S_i\cap S_j = \phi(i\neq j)\stopformula
Thus, the sets $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_m$ are pairwise disjoint sets, and their union is $S$. The subsets $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_m$ are
called the {\it parts} of the partition. Note that by this definition a part of the partition may be empty, but usually there is
no advantage in considering partitions with one or more empty sets. The number of objects of a set $S$ is denoted by $|S|$, and is
called the {\it size} of $S$.

\subsection{Addition Principle}
Suppose that a $S$ is partitioned into pairwise disjoint partys $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_m$. The number of objects in $S$ can be
determined by finding the number of objects in each of the parts, and adding the numbers so obtained:
\startformula |S| = |S_1| + |S_2| + \ldots |S_m|.\stopformula
If the sets $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_m$ are allowed to overlap, then a more profound principle, the inclusion-exclusion principle can
be used to count the number of objects in $S$.

We need to be careful when partitioning $S$ into too many parts. For example, if we partition $S$ into parts in such a way that
each part contains only one element then addition princinple is becomes counting the number of parts, which is basically same as
listing all objects of $S$. Thus the art of applying addition princinple is to partition the set $S$ into not too many parts.

\noindent{\bf Example:} In a university there are four mathematics courses, two economics courses, and three lietrature
courses. A student is allowed to enroll into one course at most. Thus, we see that a student can take a course in $4 + 2 + 3 = 9$
ways.

Next principle is multiplication principle which will be stated for two sets, but it can be generalized to any finite number of
sets.

\subsection{Multiplication Principle}
Let $S$ be a set of ordered pairs $(a, b)$, where the first object comes from a set of size $p$, and for each choice of object $a$
there are $q$ choices for object $b$. Then the size of $S$ is $p\times q$:
\startformula |S| = p\times q\stopformula
As in basic arithmetic multiplication is repeated addition, similarly multiplication principle is actuallly a consequence of the
addition principle i.e. repeated addition. Let $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_p$ be $p$ different choices for the object $a$. We partition
$S$ into parts $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_p$ where $S_i$ is the set of ordered pairs in $S$ with first object $a_i(i = 1, 2, \ldots,
p)$. The size of each $S_i$ is $q$; hence, by the addition principle,
\startformula |S| = |S_1| + |S_2| + \ldots + |S_p|\stopformula
\startformula = q + q + \ldots + q(p q'\text{s})\stopformula
\startformula = p\times q\stopformula
The multiplication principle can be stated in another way as: If a first task has $p$ outcomes, and no matter what the outcome of of
the first task, a second task has $q$ outcomes i.e. outcomes for two tasks are mutually exclusive, then the two tasks can be
performed in $p\times q$ outcomes.

\noindent{\bf Example:} Pencil comes in two different lengths, four different hardness, and three different thickness. How many
different types of pencils are there?

The pencil has three different properties, which are exclusive of each other, and thus, we can apply multiplication
principle. Hence, number of different types of pencils is $2\times4\times3 = 24$.

\noindent{\bf Example:} The number of ways a man, woman, boy, and girl can be selected from three men, three women, five boys and
four girls is $3\times3\times5\times4 = 180$.

\noindent{\bf Example:} Determine the number of positive integers that are factors of the number
\startformula 2^3\times3^4\times5^5\times7^7\stopformula
The numbers $2, 3, 5,$ and $7$ are prime numbers. By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, each factor is of the form
\startformula 2^i\times3^j\times5^k\times7^l\stopformula
where $0\leq i\leq2, 0\leq j\leq3, 0\leq k\leq5,$ and $0\leq l\leq7$. There are three choices for $i$, four for $j$, six for $k$, and
eight for $l$. By multiplication principle, the number of factors is $3\times4\times6\times8 = 576$.

In the multiplication principle the $q$ choices for object $b$ may vary with the choices of $a$. The only requirement is that there
be the same number $q$ of choices, not necessarily the same choices.

\noindent{\bf Example:} How many two-digit numbers have distinct, and nonzero digits?

A two-digit number $ab$ can be regarded as an ordered pair $(a, b)$, where $a$ is the tens digit, and $b$ is the units digit. Both
are not allowed to be $0$, and they must be different. Thus, we see that there are $9$ ways to choose $a$, which are $1, 2, \ldots,
9$. Once $a$ is chosen we cannot use the same digit for $b$, which means we are left with $8$ choices for $b$. Here we see that
choice of $a$ makes a difference on what choices $b$ has. However, for multiplication principle to be applicable what matters is
that the number of choices remain constant which is $8$ in this case. Applying multiplication principle, we arrive at the answer of
the question as $9\times8 = 72$.

There is another way to arrive at the same result. Total number of two-digit number is $90, 10,11, 12, \ldots, 99$. Of these $90$
numbers $9$ have a zero in them$(10, 20, 30, \ldots, 90)$, and $9$ have repeated digits$(11, 22, \ldots, 99)$. Thus, total number of
required numbers equals $90 - 9 - 9 = 72$.

We can derive two important ideas from the previous example. First is that it is possible to solve a counting problem in many
ways. The second idea is that to find the number of objects in a set $A$ (in this csae the set of two-digit numbers with nonzero,
and distinct digits) it may be easier to find the number of objects in a larger set $U$ containing $S$ (the set of all
two-digit numbers), and then subtract the number of objects of $U$ that do not belong to $A$ (the two-digit numbers containing $0$
or repeated digit). This leads us to subtraction principle.

\subsection{Subtraction Principle:}
Let $A$ be a set, and let $U$ be a larger set containing $A$. Let
\startformula \overline{A} = U\textbackslash A = \{x\in U: x\notin A\}\stopformula
be the complement of $A$ in $U$. Then the numebr $|A|$ of object in $A$ is given by the rule
\startformula |A| = |U| - |\overline{A}|\stopformula

The set $U$ is usually some natural set containing all the objects under discussion (it is called {\it universal set}). Using
the subtraction principle should be used only if it is easier to count the number of object in $U$ nd $\overline{A}$ tha to count the
number of objects in $A$.

\noindent{\bf Example:} Most websites on internet have a lower limit of $8$ characters as password length. Suppose if these
passwordss are to made up of the digits $0, 1, 2, \ldots, 9$, and the lowercase letters $a, b, c, \ldots, z$ then how many passwords
will have a repeated symbol?

There are a total of $10$ digits, and $26$ letters i.e. 36 symbols. So by two applications of multiplication principle, we get
\startformula |U| = 36^8 = 2,821,109,907,456\stopformula
and
\startformula |\overline{A}| = 36.35.34.33.32.31.30.29 = 1,220,096,908,800\stopformula
Therefore,
\startformula |A| = |U| - |\overline{A}| = 1,601,012,998,656.\stopformula

Now we will formulate the last principle of counting principles.

\subsection{Division Principle}
Let $S$ be a finite set that is partitioned into $k$ parts in such a way that each part contains the same number of objects. Then
the number of parts in the partition is given by the rule
\startformula k = \frac{|S|}{\text{number of objects in a part}}\stopformula

\noindent{\bf Example;} There are $240$ rats in a collection of cages. If each cage contains $2$ rats, the number of cages
equals \startformula \frac{240}{2} = 120.\stopformula

Interesting problems of division principle will be found in the problems section.

Most counting problems can be classified as one of the following types:

\startitemize[n]
\item Count the number of ordered arrangements or ordered selection of objects
  \startitemize[i]
  \item without repeating any object,
  \item with repetion(perhaps limited) of objects permitted.
  \stopitemize
\item Count the number of unordered arrangements or unordered selection of objects
  \startitemize[i]
    \item without repeating any object,
  \item with repetion(perhaps limited) of objects permitted.
  \stopitemize
\stopitemize

We can represent repetition, and nonrepetition of objects as selection from a set, and a multiset. The latter might prove to be more
useful in some cases. A {\it multiset} is like a set except that its members need not be distinct.\footnote{Thus, a cardinal
rule of sets is broken by multisets because a set is not supposed to have duplicates or repeated elements. The set $\{a, a, b\}$ is
same as the set $\{a, b\}$ but not so for multisets} For example, a multiset $M$ with three $a$'s, two $b$'s i.e. $5$ elements of
$2$ different types. We usually indicate a multiset by specifying the number of times different types of elements occur in
it. Thus, $M$ is denoted by $\{3.a,2.b\}$.\footnote{In standard set-theory's notation, we could denote the multiset $M$ using
ordered pairs as $\{(a, 3), (b, 2)\}$}. The numbers $3$, and $2$ are the {\it repetition members} of the multiset $M$. Thus we
can extrapolate that a set is a multiset with all repetition numbers equal to $1$. Often there is no limit on number of repetitions
i.e. infinite repetitions are allowed.\footnote{In no circumstance, we need to consider different sizes of $\infty$.}

\section{Factorial of $n$}
Factorial of $n$ is denoted by $n!$. In the old style it is written as \m{\oldfact{n}}. $n!$ is given by the first $n$ natural
numbers, i.e. \startformula n! = 1.2.3.4\ldots(n - 1).n\stopformula Also, $0! = 1$, which we will prove later.

Permutation means arrangement of objects along with selection. In the permutation of object order matter. If order of object
changes then their permutation also changes. Combination of objects means selection of objects in such a way that order does not
matter.

\section{Permutation of Sets}
Let $r\in \mathbb{P}$. By an $r$-{\it permutation} of a set $S$ of $n$ elements has a meaning of an ordered(by definition of
permutation) arrangement of $r$ of the $n$ elements$(r\leq n)$. If $S = \{a, b, c\},$ then the three $1$-permutations of $S$ are
\startformula a\,\m\,b\,\,\,c,\stopformula
the six $2$-permutations of $S$ are
\startformula ab\,\,\,ac\,\,\,ba\,\,\,bc\,\,\,ca\,\,\,cb,\stopformula
and the six $3$-permutations of $S$ are
\startformula abc\;\;acb\;\;bac\;\;bca\;\;cab\;\;cba.\stopformula

There are no $4$-permutations of $S$ because that will violate the assumption that $r\leq n$.

The $r$-permutations of an $n$-element set is denoted by $P(n, r)$ or ${}_nP_r$ or ${}^nP_r$ or $P_r^^n$. If $r > n$ then ${}^nP_r =
0$. Clearly, ${}^nP_1 = n$ for each $n\in \mathbb{P}$.

For $n$ and $r$ positive integers with $r\leq n,$ \startformula {}^nP_r = n\times(n - 1)\times\ldots\times(n - r + 1).\stopformula

Permutation of $n$ objects taken $r$ at a time is equivalent ot filling $r$ different vacant spots from $n$ different objects. We
can fill first spot by $n$ ways, second spot can be filled by remaining objects i.e. $n - 1$ ways, and proceeding this way we find
that $r$th spot can be filled in $n - r + 1$ ways. Thus total number of ways is \startformula n\times(n - 1)\times\ldots(n - r + 1).\stopformula

We can rewrite the above as \startformula \frac{n\times(n - 1)\ldots(n - r + 1)\times(n - r)\times\ldots2\times 1}{(n - r)\times(n - r -
  1)\times\ldots2\times1}\stopformula
\startformula {}^nP_r = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}\stopformula

Alternatively, first place can be filled in $n$ ways. Rest of $r - 1$ spots from $n - 1$ objects can be filled in ${}^{n - 1}P_{r -
1}$ ways. Thus, ${}^nP_r = n.{}^{n - 1}P_{r - 1}$. Similarly, ${}^{n - 1}P_{r - 1} = (n - 1).{}^{n - 2}P_{r - 2}$. Proceeding this
way we find that ${}^{n - r + 1}P_1 = n - r + 1$. Multiplying and cancelling common factors, we get ${}^nP_r = n\times(n -
1)\times\ldots\times(n - r + 1).$

The number of permutations of $n$ elements is ${}^nP_n = \frac{n!}{0!} = n!$. If we follow first result then it is evident that $0!
= 1.$

\subsection{Meaning of $\frac{1}{(-k)!}, k\in\mathbb{P}$}
We have ${}^nP_r = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}$. Putting $r = n + k$, we have ${}^nP_{n + k} = \frac{n!}{(-k)!}$. But the number of ways of
arranging $n + 1$ objects out of $n$ different objects $= 0 \Rightarrow \frac{1}{(-k)!} = 0.$

\noindent{\bf Note:} Although $(-k)!$ has no meaning by the definition of factorial but if we consider the above result then the
formula for permutation becomes valid even for $r > n.$

\subsection{Circular Permutation}
Let us consider arranging objects along a circle. Let us consider that four persons $A, B, C,$ and $D$ are sitting around a table. We
can have following arrangements:

\startplacefigure[location=force]
  \startMPcode
    draw fullcircle scaled 2cm;
    draw fullcircle scaled 2cm shifted (3cm, 0);
    draw fullcircle scaled 2cm shifted (6cm, 0);
    draw fullcircle scaled 2cm shifted (9cm, 0);
    label.lft("$A$", (1cm, 0));
    label.bot("$B$", (0, 1cm));
    label.rt("$C$", (-1cm, 0));
    label.top("$D$", (0, -1cm));
    label.lft("$D$", (4cm, 0));
    label.bot("$A$", (3cm, 1cm));
    label.rt("$B$", (2cm, 0));
    label.top("$C$", (3cm, -1cm));
    label.lft("$C$", (7cm, 0));
    label.bot("$D$", (6cm, 1cm));
    label.rt("$A$", (5cm, 0));
    label.top("$C$", (6cm, -1cm));
    label.lft("$B$", (10cm, 0));
    label.bot("$C$", (9cm, 1cm));
    label.rt("$D$", (8cm, 0));
    label.top("$A$", (9cm, -1cm));
  \stopMPcode
\stopplacefigure
As shown four persons are sitting around a round table, and four anticlockwise rotations have lead to four arrangements. But if
$A,B,C,D$ are sitting in a row, and then are shiftedd such that last occupies the place of first, then the four arrangements will be
different. Thus, if there are $n$ objects then for each circular arrangement there are nn linear arrangements. But for $n$ different
objects total number of linear arrengements are $n!$ so the total number of circular arrangements are \startformula \frac{n!}{n} = (n - 1)!.\stopformula

Thus, we can say that number of circular $r$-permutations of a set of $n$ elements is given by \startformula \frac{{}^nP_r}{r} = \frac{n!}{r.(n
  - r)!}\stopformula

\subsection{Clockwise and Anti-Clockwise Arrangements}
When clockwise and anticlockwise arranegemnts are same then total number of permutations will become half of what we computed in
previous case i.e. \startformula \frac{{}^nP_r}{2r} = \frac{n!}{2r.(n - r)!}\stopformula

\section{Combination of Sets}
Consider a set $S$ having $n$ elements. A {\it combination} of a set $S$ has a meaning of an unordered selection of the elements
of $S$. The result of each selection is a {\it subset} $A$ of the elements of $S: A\subset S$. Thus, the terms
{\it combination} and {\it subset} are interchangeable.

Now let $r$ be a non-negative integer. By an $r$-{\it combination} of a set $S$ of $n$ elements, we understand an unordered
selection of $r$ of the $n$ objects of $S$. The result will be an $r$-subset of $S$.

If $S = \{a, b, c, d\},$ then \startformula \{a, b, c\}, \{a, b, c\}, \{a, c, d\}, \{b, c, d\}\stopformula are the four $3$-subsets of $S$. We denote
the number of $r$-subsets or $r$-combinations of an $n$-element set by $\binom{n}{r}$ or ${}_nC_r$ or
${}^nC_r$ or $C_r^^n$. Obviously,
\startformula \binom{n}{r} = 0\;\;\;\;\text{if~}r > n.\stopformula
Also,
\startformula \binom{0}{r} = 0\;\;\;\;\text{if~}r > 0.\stopformula

The following facts are easy to figure out for each non-negative integer $n$ \startformula \binom{0}{0} = \binom{n}{0} = \binom{n}{n} = 1, \binom{n}{1} = n,\stopformula

For $0\leq r\leq n,$ \startformula {}^nP_r = r!{}^nC_r.\stopformula
Hence,
\startformula {}^nC_r = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}\stopformula

Let $S$ be an $n$-element set. Each $r$-permutation of $S$ arises from following tasks
\startitemize[n]
\item Choose $r$ elements from $S$.
\item Arrange the chose $r$ elements in some order.
\stopitemize

The number of ways to carry out first task, by definition, is ${}^nC_r$. The number of ways to carry out second task is ${}^nP_r =
r!$. By the multiplication principle, we have ${}^nP_r = r!{}^nC_r$. Now applying the formula for permutations, we have
\startformula {}^nC_r = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}.\stopformula

\section{Permutation of Multisets}
Let $S$ be a multiset with objects of $k$ different types, where each object can be repeated infinitely. Then the number of
$r$-permutations of $S$ is $k^r$.

To prove this, we can choose the first item to be an object of any one of the $k$ types. Since the number of repetitions are
infinite the second item can be also chose in $k$ ways. In fact, any item can be chosen in $k$ ways due to infinite
repetition. Following, multiplication principle, total number of such permutations is $k^r$.

Let $S$ be a multiset with objects of $k$ different types with finite repetition numbers $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k$ respectively. Let
the size of $S$ be $n = n_1 + n_2 + \ldots + n_k.$ Then the number of permutations of $S$ equals \startformula \frac{n!}{n_!!n_2!\ldots
  n_k!}.\stopformula

We can calculate this by thinking in terms of $n$ places, and we want to put exactly one of the objects of $S$ in each of the
places. We have $n_1$ objects of one type in $S$, so we must choose a subset of $n_1$ places from the set of $n$ places. We can do
this in ${}^nC_{n_1}$ ways. After this we have $n - n_1$ places left, and we have $n_2$ objects of second type. So following
similarly we can do this in ${}^{n - n_1}C_{n_2}$ ways. Following this way invoking multiplication principle, the number of
permutations of $S$ equals
\startformula {}^nC_{n_1}.{}^{n - n_1}C_{n_2}.{}^{n - n_1 - n_2}C_{n_3}\ldots{}^{n - n_1 - n_2 - \ldots - n_{k - 1}}C_{n_k}\stopformula
which gives
\startformula \frac{n!}{n_1!(n - n_1)!}.\frac{(n - n_1)!}{n_2!(n - n_1 - n_2)!}.\frac{(n - n_1 - n_2)!}{n_3!(n - n_1 - n_2 -n_3)!}\ldots
\frac{(n - n_1 - n_2 - \ldots - n_{k - 1})!}{n_k!(n - n_1 - n_2 - \ldots - n_k)!}\stopformula
which after cancellation, reduces to
\startformula \frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\ldots n_k!}\stopformula

Let $n$ be a positive integer, and let $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k$ be positive integers with $n = n_1 + n_2 + \ldots + n_k$. The number
of ways to partition a set of $n$ objects into $k$ labeled boxes in which Box 1 contains $n_1$ objects, Box 2 contains $n_2$
objects, $\ldots$, Box $k$ contains $n_k$ objects equals
\startformula \frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\ldots n_k!}.\stopformula

If the boxes are not labeled, and $n_1 = n_2 = \ldots = n_k$, then the number of partitions equals \startformula \frac{n!}{k!n_1!n_2!\ldots
  n_k!}.\stopformula

We can calculate this by direct application of the multiplication principle. So we first choose $n_1$ objects for the first box,
then $n_2$ of the remaining $n - n_1$ objects for the second box and so on. By the multiplication principle, the number of ways is
\startformula {}^nC_{n_1}.{}^{n - n_1}C_{n_2}.{}^{n - n_1 - n_2}C_{n_3}\ldots{}^{n - n_1 - n_2 - \ldots - n_{k - 1}}C_{n_k}\stopformula
which is same as the last result, i.e.
\startformula \frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\ldots n_k!}\stopformula

If boxes are not labeled and $n_1 = n_2 = \ldots = n_k,$ then the result has to be divided by $k!$ because for each way of
distributing the objects into the $k$ unalbeled boxes there are $k!$ ways in which we can attach the labels to the boxes. Thus,
using the division principle, we arrive at the result as
\startformula \frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\ldots n_k!}.\stopformula

\section{Combination of Multisets}
If $S$ is a multiset, then an $r$-combination of $S$ is an unorndered selection of $r$ of the objects of $S$. Thus, an
$r$-combination of $S$ is itslef a multiset, a {\it submultiset} of $S$ of size $r$, or, for short, an $r$-submultiset. If $S$
has $n$ objects, then there is only one $n$-combination of $S$, namely, $S$ itself. If $S$ contains objects of $k$ different types,
then there are $k 1$-combinations of $S$.

Let $S$ be a multiset with objects of $k$ types, each with an infinite repetitions, then the number of $r$-combinations of $S$
equals
\startformula {}^{r + k - 1}C_r = {}^{r + k - 1}C_{k - 1}.\stopformula

Let $k$ types of objects of $S$ be $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k$ so that
\startformula S = \{\infty.a_1, \infty.a_2, \ldots, \infty.a_k\}\stopformula

Any $r$-combination of $S$ is of the form $\{x_1.a_1, x_2.a_2, \ldots, x_k.a_k\}$, where $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_k$ are non-negative
integers with $x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_k = r$. The converse is also true. Thus, the number of $r$-combinations of $S$ equals the
number of solutions of the equation \startformula x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_k = r.\stopformula

We will show that the number of solutions of this equation is given by number of permuations of the multiset
\startformula T = \{r.1, (k - 1).*\}\stopformula
of $r + k - 1$ objects of two different types. Given a permuation of $T,$ the $k - 1 *$'s divide the $r 1$s into $k$ groups. Let
there be $x_1 1$s to the left of the first $*, x_2 1$s between the first and second $*,\ldots,$ and $x_k 1$s to the right of last
$*$. Clearly, $x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_k = r$. The converse of this is also true. Thus, required combination is given by the
formula \startformula {}^{r + k - 1}C_r = {}^{r + k - 1}C_{k - 1}.\stopformula

\section{Some Important Indentities}
\startitemize[n]
\item ${}^nP_r = r.{}^{n - 1}P_{r - 1} + {}^{n - 1}P_r$.
\item ${}^nC_r = {}^nC_{n - r}$.
\item ${}^nC_{r - 1} + {}^nC_r = {}^{n + 1}C_r$.
\item ${}^nC_r = {}^nC_s \Rightarrow r = s$ or $r + s = n$.
\item ${}^nC_r = \frac{n - r + 1}{r}.{}^nC_{r - 1}\;(1\leq r\leq n)$.
\item If $n$ is even, then the greatest value of ${}^nC_r$ is ${}^nC_m$, where $m = n/2$. If $n$ is odd, then the greatet value is
  ${}^nC_m$, where $m = (n - 1)/2$ or $m = (n + 1)/2$.
\item If $n = 2m + 1$, then ${}^nC_0 < {}^nC_1 < {}^nC_2 < \ldots < {}^nC_m = {}^nC_{m + 1}$. ${}^nC_{m + 1} > {}^nC_{m + 2} >
  \ldots > {}^nC_n$.
\item If $n = 2m + 1$, then ${}^nC_0 < {}^nC_1 < {}^nC_2 < \ldots <{}^nC_m > {}^nC_{m + 1} > {}^nC_{m + 1} > \ldots > {}^nC_n$.

\section{Permutations with Repetitions}
The objective is to find permutation of $r$ objects out of $n$ objects of which $p$ are of one type, $q$ of second type and so on.

Let the different objects be denoted by $a, b, c, \ldots$

Consider the product \startformula \left(1 + \frac{ax}{1!} + \frac{a^2x^2}{2!} + \ldots + \frac{a^px^p}{p!}\right)\left(1 + \frac{bx}{1!} +
\frac{b^2x^2}{2!} + \ldots + \frac{b^qx^q}{q!}\right)\ldots\stopformula

Required number of permutations $=$ sum of all possible terms of the form $= \frac{r!}{p!q!\ldots}a^pb^q\ldots$ where $p + q + \ldots
= r$

$= r!$. coeff. of $x^r$ in $\left[\left(1 + \frac{x}{1!} + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \ldots + \frac{x^p}{p!}\right)\left(1 + \frac{x}{1!} +
\frac{x^2}{2!} + \ldots + \frac{x^q}{q!}\right)\ldots\right]$

\section{Combinations with Repetitions}
The objective is to find combinations of $r$ objects out of $n$ objects under different cases of repetitions. To begin with we
consider combinations of $r$ objects taken out of $n$ objects of which $p$ are of one type, $q$ of the second type and so on.

Let the different things be denoted by the letters $a, b, \ldots$

Consider the product $(1 + ax + a^2x^2 + \ldots + a^px^2)(1 + bx + b^2x^2 + \ldots + b^qx^2)\ldots$. All the terms in the product
is of the same degree in the letters $a, b, \ldots$ as in $x$. The coefficient of $x^r$ in the product is the number of ways of
taking $r$ of the letters $a, b, \ldots$ with the restriction that maximum number of $a$'s is $p$, maximum number of $b$'s is $q$ and so
on. Coeff. of $x^r$ will not change if $a = b = \ldots = 1$. Thus required number of combinaitons = Coeff. of $x^r$ in $(1 + x + x^2 +
\ldots + x^2)(1 + x + x^2 + \ldots + x^2)\ldots$

Similarly, number of combinaitons of $r$ objects out of $n$ objects of which $p$ are of one type, $q$ are of second type and $(n -
p - q)$ things are all different $=$ Coeff. of $x^r$ in $[(1 + x + x^2 + \ldots + x^p)(1 + x + x^2 + \ldots + x^q)(1 + x)(1 +
  x)\ldots \text{~to~} (n - p - q)\text{factors~}]$

$=$ Coeff. of $x^r$ in $[(1 + x + x^2 + \ldots + x^p)(1 + x + x^2 + \ldots + x^q)(1 + x)(1 + x)^{n - p - q}]$

Similarly, number of combinations of $r$ objects out of $n$ objects of which $p$ are of one type, $q$ are of second type and so on,
when each thing is taken at least once $=$ Coeff. of $x^r$ in $[(x + x^2 + \ldots + x^p)(x + x^2 + \ldots + x^q)\ldots]$

$=$ Coeff. of $x^{r - 3}$ in $[(1 + x + x^2 + \ldots + x^p)(1 + x + x^2 + \ldots + x^q)$

If $n$ is a negative integer, then $(1 + x)^n = 1 + \frac{n}{1!}x + \frac{n(n - 1)}{2!}x^2 + \ldots\text{~to~}\infty$ [this comes
  from binomial theorem]

So if $n$ is a positive inetger then $(1 + x)^{-n} = 1 + \frac{n}{1!}x + \frac{n(n + 1)}{2!}x^2 + \ldots\text{~to~}\infty$

Coeff. of $x^r$ in $(1 - x)^{-n} = {}^{n + r - 1}C_r$ which is number of ways in which $r$ identical objects can be distributed
among $n$ persons can get zero of more objects $=$ Coeff. of $x^r$ in $(1 + x + \ldots + x^r)^n = \left(\frac{1 - x^{r + 1}}{1 -
    x}\right)^n = [(1 - x^{r + 1})(1 - x)^{-n}]$.

$=$ Coeff. of $x^r$ in $(1 - x)^{-n}$ (leaving powers higher than $x^r$) $= {}^{n + r - 1}C_r$.

\section{Integral Solutions of Equations}
As we have proved earlier, for equation $x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_r = n$ is equivalent of distributing $r$ identical objects among
$n$ persons when each person getting zero or more things $= {}^{n + r - 1}C_r$

Similarly, number of non-negative integral solutions of equation $x + 2y + 3z + 4w = n$, equals coeff. of $x^n$ in $[(1 - x)^{-1}(1
  - x)^{-2}(1 - x)^{-3}(1 - x)^{-4}]$.

Similarly, number of positive integral solutions of equation $x + 2y + 3z + 4w = n$, equals coeff. of $x^{n -(1 + 2 + 3 + 4})$ in
$[(1 - x)^{-1}(1 - x)^{-2}(1 - x)^{-3}(1 - x)^{-4}]$.

\section{Geometrical Applications of Combinations}
Some basic geometrical results involving combinations are given below:
\startitemize[n]
\item $n$ non-concurrent and non-parallel straight lines, points of intersection are ${}^nC_2$.
\item The number of straight lines constructed out of $n$ points, when no three points are collinear, are ${}^nC_2$.
\item Given $n$ points, if $m$ are collinear, then number of straight lines possible are ${}^nC_2 - {}^mC_2 + 1$.
\item In a polygon, total number of diagonals out of a $n$ points, when no three points are collinear, are $\frac{n(n - 3)}{2}$.
\item Number of triangles formed from $n$ points, when no three points are collinear, are ${}^nC_3$.
\item Number of triangles formed out of $n$ points in which $m$ are collinear, ${}^nC_3 - {}^mC_3$.
\item Number of triangles constructed out of $n$ points, when none of the side is common with the sides of polygon, are ${}^nC_3 -
  {}^nC_1 - {}^nC_1.{}^{n - 4}C_1$.
\item Number of parallelogram constructed by two system of parallel lines, when first set contains $m$ parallel lines and second
  set contains $n$ parallel lines, are ${}^nC_2\times{}^mC_2$.
\item Number of squares formed by two system of parallel lines in which first set is perpendicular to second set of lines, when
  first set contains $m$ parallel lines and second set contains $n$ parallel lines is $\displaystyle\sum_{r=1}^{m - 1}(m - r)(n -
  r);\;m<n$.
\stopitemize

\section{Number of Divisors and Sum of Divisors}
Let $n = p_1^{n_1}.p_2^{n_2}\ldots p_n^{n_k}$ where $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k$ are distinct prime numbers and $n_1, n_2, \ldots,
n_k\in \mathbb{P}$. Obvously, any divisor of $n$ is of the form $d = p_1^{m_1}.p_2^{m_2}\ldots p_k^{m_k}$ where $m_1, m_2,
\ldots\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $0\leq m_i\leq n_i, i = 1, 2, \ldots, k$. Therefore, the total no. of divisors for $n$ will be equal
to the number of ways of selecting at least one from $n_1$ identical prime numbers $p_1, n_2$ primes $p_2$ and so on. The number of
such ways is \startformula (n_1 + 1)(n_2 + 1)\ldots(n_k + 1).\stopformula These divisors will also include $1$ and $n$, so obviously, number of divisors
other than $1$ and $n$ is \startformula (n_1 + 1)(n_2 + 1)\ldots(n_k + 1) - 2\stopformula

The sum of all divisors for $n$ is given by \startformula \sum_{r_1=0}^{n_1}\sum_{r_2=0}^{n_2}\ldots\sum_{r_k=0}^{n_k}
p_1^{r_1}p_2^{r_2}\ldots p_k^{r_k}\stopformula

\startformula =\left(\frac{p_1^{n_1 + 1} - 1}{p_1 - 1}\right)\left(\frac{p_2^{n_2 + 1} - 1}{p_2 - 1}\right)\ldots\left(\frac{p_k^{n_k + 1} - 1}{p_k -
  1}\right)\stopformula

\section{Exponent of Prime $p$ in $n!$}
Let $E_p(m)$ denote the exponent of the prime $p$ in the positive integer $m$. We have \startformula E_p(n!) = E_p[1.2.3.4\ldots(n - 1).n]\stopformula
The last integer amongst $1, 2, 3, \ldots, (n - 1), n$ which is divisible by $p$ is $[n/p]p$, where $[x]$ denotes the greatest
integer $\leq x$. Therefore, \startformula E_p(n!) = E_p\left(p.2p.3p\ldots \left[\frac{n}{p}p\right]\right)\stopformula because the remaining integers
from the set $(1, 2, 3, \ldots, (n - 1), n)$ are not divisible by $p$.

\startformula E_p(n!) = \left[\frac{n}{p}\right] + E_p\left(1.2.3\ldots \left[\frac{n}{p}\right]\right)\stopformula

The last integer amongst $1, 2, \ldots, [n/p]$ which is divisible by $p$ is \startformula \left[\frac{[n/p]}{p}\right]p =
\left[\frac{n}{p^2}\right]p\stopformula

\startformula \Rightarrow E_p(n!) = \left[\frac{n}{p}\right] + \left[\frac{n}{p^2}\right] + E_p\left(1.2\ldots\left[\frac{n}{p^2}\right]\right)\stopformula

Proceeding similarly, \startformula E_p(n!) = \left[\frac{n}{p}\right] + \left[\frac{n}{p^2}\right] + \ldots \left[\frac{n}{p^s}\right]\stopformula
where $p^s\leq n\leq p^{s+1}$

\section{Inclusion-Exclusion Principle(PIE)}
We have seen examples of subtraction principle. Inclusion exclusion principle is an extension of subtraction principle. In this
type of problems, it is easier to make an indect coutnt of object in a set rather than to count the objects directly. Consder
following examples:

\noindent{\bf Example:} Count the permutations $i_1i_2\ldots i_n$ of ${1, 2, \ldots, n}$ in which $1$ is not in the first
position i.e $i_1\neq 1$.

The number of permutations of $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ with $1$ in the first position is the same as the number $(n - 1)!$ of
permutations of $2, 3, \ldots, n$. Since the total umber permutations is $n!$, required number of permutations is $n! - (n - 1)! =
(n - 1).(n - 1)!.$

\noindent{\bf Definition:} The number of objects of the set $S$ that have none of the properties $P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_m$ is
given by the alternating expression
\startformula \displaystyle|\bar{A_1}\cap\bar{A_2}\cap\ldots\cap\bar{A_m}| = |S| - \sum|A_i| + \sum|A_i\cap A_j| -\sum|A_i\cap A_j\cap A_k| +
\ldots + (-1)^m|A_1\cap A_2\cap\ldots A_m|,\stopformula
where the first sum is over all $1$-subsets of $\{i\}$ of $\{1, 2, \ldots,m\},$ the second sum is over all $2$-subsets $\{i, j\}$
of $\{1, 2, \ldots, m\}$ the third sum is all over $3$-subsets $\{i, j, k\}$ of $\{1, 2, \ldots, m\},$ and so until the $m$th sum
over all $m$-subsets of $\{1, 2, \ldots, 2\}$ of which the only one is itself.

The subtraction principle is the simplest instance of inclusion-exclusion principle. As a first generalization of the substraction
principle, let $S$ be a finite set of objects, and let $P_1$ and $P_2$ be two "properties" that each objects in $S$ may or may not
possess. We wish to count the number of object in $S$ that have neither the properties of $P_1$ and $P_2$. Extending the
subtracting principle, we can do this by first including of all objects of $S$ in our count, then excluding all objects that have
property $P1$ and excluding all objects that have property $P_2$, and then noting that we have excluded objects having both
properties twice, readmitting all such objects once. Let $A_1$ be the subset of objects of $S$ that have property $A_1$, and let
$A_2$ be the subset that have property $P_1$. Then $\bar{A_1}$ consists of those which do not have property $P_1$, and similarly
$\bar{A_2}$ consists of those which do not have property $P_2$. The objects of set $\bar{A_1}\cap\bar{A_2}$ are those that have
neither property $P_1$ nor property $P_1$. Thus, we have

\startformula |\bar{A_1}\cap\bar{A_2}| = |S| - |A_1| - |A_2| + |A_1\cap A_2|.\stopformula

To further prove this, we argue as follows. Consider an object $x$ which has neither the property $P_1$, nor the property $P_2$. In
this case the contribution towards the count by this object would be $1 - 0 - 0 + 0 = 1$. Next, we consider if the object $x$ has
property $P_2$, then its contribution is $1 - 1 - 0 + 0 = 0$. Similarly, if it has property $P_1$, then its contribution is $1 - 0
- 1 + 0 = 0$. For the last possibility when $x$ has both the properties its contribution is $1 - 1 - 1 + 1 = 0$. As it is obvious
any object will fall in either of these four possibilities and the total contribution is $1$ only when it has neither of the
properties. The inclusion-exclusion principle stated above is generalizatio of this two property example. We will now establish the
validity of the general case.

First, we conisder an object $x$ with none of the properties. Its contribution to the right side would be $1 - 0 + 0 - 0 + \ldots +
(-1)^m0 = 1$ since it is in $S$ but in none of the other sets. Now consider an object $y$ with exactly $n\geq 1$ of the
properties. The contribution of $y$ to $|S| = 1 = {}^nC_0$. Its contribution to $\sum|A_i|$ is $n = {}^nC_1$ since it has exactly
$n$ of the properties and so it is a member of exactly $n$ of the sets out of $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_m$. Similarly, the contribution
of $y$ to $\sum|A_i\cap A_j|$ is ${}^nC_2$ sinc ewe may select a pair of the properties $y$ has in ${}^nC_2$ ways. Following
similarly, the net contribution of $y$ is
\startformula {}^nC_0 - {}^nC_1 + {}^nC_2 - \ldots + (-1)^m{}^nC_m\stopformula
which equal
\startformula {}^nC_0 - {}^nC_1 + {}^nC_2 - \ldots + (-1)^n{}^nC_n\stopformula
because \startformula n\leq m\stopformula and ${}^nC_k = 0$ if $k > n$. The last expression is $0$ from binomial theorem. Following similarly, we prove
the inclusion-exclusion principle.

\noindent{\bf Definition:} The number of objects of $S$ which have at least one of the properties $P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_m$ is
given by \startformula |A_1\cup A_2\cup \ldots\cup A_m| = \sum|Ai| - \sum|A_i\cap A_j| + \sum|A_i\cap A_j\cap A_k| - \ldots +(-1)^{m +
  1}|A_1\cap A_2\cap \ldots\cap A_m|\stopformula

The set $A_1\cup A_2\cup \ldots\cup A_m$ consiste of all those objects in $S$ which possess at least one of the
properties. Also, \startformula |A_1\cup A_2\cup \ldots\cup A_m| = |S| - |\overline{A_1\cup A_2\cup \ldots\cup A_m}|.\stopformula

From Demorgan's law \startformula |\overline{A_1\cup A_2\cup \ldots\cup A_m}| = \bar{A_1}\cap\bar{A_2}\cap\ldots\cap\bar{A_m}\stopformula

Following result from previous definition, we have the required equality.

\subsection{A Special Case of PIE}
For any set $A$ having $n\geq 2$ element, $|A_1 + A_2 + \cdots + A_n = \displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^n|A_i| -
\sum_{i<j}A_iA_j + \sum_{i,j<k}A_iA_jA_k| - \cdots +(-1)^n|A_1A_2\ldots A_n|$

In some problems we deal with properties $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ and numerical values associated with
properties i.e. $n(a_1), n(a_2), \ldots, n(a_n), n(a_1a_2), \ldots, n(a_{n-1}a_n) \ldots$ and so on.

We can have

\startitemize[n]
\item $n(a_1) = n(a_2) = \cdots = n(a_n)$
\item $n(a_1a_2) = n(a_2a_3) = \cdots = n(a_1a_n) = n(a_2a_3) = \cdots = n(a_{n - 1}a_n)$
\item $n(a_1a_2a_3) = n(a_1a_2a_4) = \cdots = n(a_ia_ja_k)$, where $i\neq j\neq k$
\stopitemize
and so on.

Let $N(r)$ denote the common properties of $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ when taken $r$ at a time. $N(0)$ is the
value of $n(a_1'a_2'\ldots a_n')$, where $a_i'$ is the complementary property of $a_i$, and $N$ is the value
of collection of zero property or at least one property.

Now we can rewrite the PIE in the form of

\startformula
  N(0) = N - C_1^^nN(1) + C_2^^nN(2) - C_3^^nN(3) + \cdots + (-1)^nC_n^^nN(n)
\stopformula
\section{Derangements}
Consider following problems. At a party $14$ gentlemen check their overcoats. In how many ways can their overcoats be returned so
that no gentleman get their own overcoat? In a cricket team there are $11$ players who bat in a certain order. In how many ways
those can bat so that no player bats at their pre-determined position? This type of problems fall in the category of following
general problem.

Given an $n$-element set $S$ in which each element has a specified position. We have to find the number of permutations of $S$ in
which no element is in its specified position. This can be exemplified by a set $S = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ in which location of each
integer is that specified by its position in the sequence $1, 2, \ldots, n$. A derangement $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ is a permutation
of $i_1i_2\ldots i_n$ of $1, 2, \ldots, n$ sucb that $i_\neq 1, i_2\neq 2, \ldots, i_n\neq n$. Derangement of such an $n$-element
set is denoted by $D_n$

For $n\geq 1$ \startformula D_n = n!\left(1 - \frac{1}{1!} + \frac{1}{2!} - \frac{1}{3!} + \ldots + (-1)^n\frac{1}{n!}\right).\stopformula

Let $T$ be the set of all $n!$ permutations of $X$. For $j = 1, 2, \ldots, n$ let $P_j$ be the property that, in a permutation, $j$
is in its proper position. Let $A_j$ denote the set of permutations with property $P_j$. Thus, \startformula D_n = |\bar{A_1}\cap\bar{A_2}\cap\ldots\cap\bar{A_n}|.\stopformula

The permutations in $A_1$ are of the form $1i_2\ldots i_n$, where $i_1\ldots i_n$ is a permutation of $\{2, \ldots, n\}$. Thus,
$|A_1| = (n - 1)!$. We can write the general form as $|A_j| = (n - 1)!$. For $A_j\cap A_k$, two elements have to be in the proper
position. So, $|A_j\cap A_k| = (n - 2)!$. For any integer $k$ with $1\leq k\leq n$, $|A_1\cap A_2\cap \ldots\cap A_k| = (n -
k)!$. Since there are ${}^nC_k$ subsets of $T$, applying the inclusion and exclusion principle, we obtain
\startformula D_n = n! - {}^nC_1(n - 1)! + {}^nC_2(n - 2)! - \ldots + (-1)^n{}^nC_n0!\stopformula
\startformula \Rightarrow D_n = n!\left(1 - \frac{1}{1!} + \frac{1}{2!} - \frac{1}{3!} + \ldots + (-1)^n\frac{1}{n!}\right).\stopformula

\section{The Bijection Principle}
Let \m{P = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\}}, and \m{Q = \{b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n\}}. If \m{f: P\rightarrow Q} is an
injective function then \m{n\leq m}. If \m{f:P\rightarrow Q} is a surjective function then \m{n\geq m}. If
\m{f: P\rightarrow Q} is injective and surjective then \m{f} is known to be a bijective function. For a
bijective function \m{n = m}.

\section{Occupancy Problems}
The problems related to distribution of balls into cells are called occupancy problems. We can have
following cases:
\subsection{Distinguishable Balls and Distinguishable Cells}
Number of ways to divide $n$ non-identical balls in $r$ different cells such that each cell gets $0$ or more
number of balls (empty cells allowed) $= r^n$.

If no cell is empty, then the number is found by the inclusion/exclusion principle or by recurrence relation
or by generating function method. Using any one of them number of ways, to divide $n$ non-identical balls in
$r$ different cells such that each cell gets at least one object, can be found.
$= r^n - C_1^^r(r - 1)^n + C_2^^r(r - 2)^n - \cdots + (-1)^rC_{r-1}^^r1^n$.

\subsection{Identical Balls and Distinguishable Cells}
If an empty cell is allowed, then the number of distributions is $C_{r - 1}C^^{n + r - 1}$.
