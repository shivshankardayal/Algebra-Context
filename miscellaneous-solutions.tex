\item Let the numbers be $a$ and $b$ and harmonic means are $h_1$ and $h_1$. Let $d$ be the c.d.\ of the
  corresponding A.P. Then

  $\frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{a} + 3d\Rightarrow d = \frac{a - b}{3ab}$

  $\frac{1}{h_1} = \frac{1}{a} + \frac{a - b}{3ab} = \frac{a + 2b}{3ab}$.

  Given that $\frac{3ab}{a + 2b} = \sqrt{ab}\Rightarrow 9a^2b^2 = (a + 2b)^2ab \Rightarrow 9ab = a^2 + 4b^2
  + 4ab$

  $\Rightarrow a^2 - 5ab + 4b^2 = 0 \Rightarrow (a - b)(a - 4b) = 0$.

  So either the numbers are equal which will make H.M.'s also equal to the numbers or one of the number is
  four times the other number.
\item Let the numbers be $a$ and $b$ and harmonic mean be $h$. Then

  $\frac{1}{h} = \frac{\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b}}{2} \Rightarrow h = \frac{2ab}{a + b} = 4 \Rightarrow 2a +
  2b - ab = 0$

  Given that $2A + G^2 = 27 \Rightarrow a + b + ab = 27 \Rightarrow a + b = 9$.

  Solving we get $a, b = 6, 3$.
\item Since $n$ is odd, the no.\ of positive term of the given series is $\frac{n + 1}{2}$ and no.\ of
  negative terms of negative terms of the series is $\frac{n - 1}{2}$.

  Sum of positive terms is $\frac{n + 1}{4}\left[2a + \frac{n - 1}{2}d\right]$ and sum of negative terms is
  $\frac{n - 1}{4}\left[2(a + d) + \frac{n - 3}{2}d\right]$.

  Adding we get the required sum.

  Alternatively we observe that first $\frac{n- 1}{2}$ pairs will have a sum of $-\frac{(n - 1)d}{2}$ and
  $n$th term is $a + (n- 1)d$. So the sum is $a + \frac{n - 1}{2}d$.
\item $x = 2n\pi\pm \cos^{-1}y$. So we see that it is a periodic function which has a period of $2\pi$. If
  we move only in one(positive/negative) direction then all values of $y$ will give an A.P., however, if we
  want to move in both directions then $x$ must be $0, \pi$ making $y = \pm1$.
\item Let $a$ be the first term and $r$ be the common ratio of the G.P. Sum of all terms is given by
  $\frac{a}{1 - r}$ and sum of odd terms is given by $\frac{a}{1 - r^2}$.

  Given that $\frac{a}{1 - r} = \frac{5a}{1 - r^2}\Rightarrow 1 + r = 5\Rightarrow r = 4$.
